This post covers some of the insights I've gotten while building ad-free, a
modularized audio ad-blocker for Android I started in 2016. Ad-free is a
proof-of-concept application to show limitations in the way how audio
advertisement is implemented on Android. It features a small Kotlin application
with a plugin-based design and a simplistic user interface. <!--more-->

## Introduction
The Android OS provides powerful mechanisms to intercept and monitor events on
the system. A [Notification Listener Service]() is an application that can
monitor calls from the operating system when new notifications are posted or
removed. Other services such as [Accessibility Services]() monitor and enhance
user interaction to support impaired users to interact with the device. These
services typically expose much information about the current user activity.
Android's UI security has been undermined in the past by these services because
they break otherwise strong principles of sandboxing between applications. A
malicious application, when granted permission by the user, may sniff sensitive
data from other apps including passwords. See <cite> Kalysch et al.[^1]</cite>
for an overview of some security implications of Android's UI services.

## Goals
With a proof-of-concept application, I aim to evaluate the expressiveness of
some of these mechanisms in the domain of audio advertisement.

The proof-of-concept is to lower system volume if the app detects advertisements
and to restore it back to normal afterward. This does not alter other apps on
the system and does not require system modifications such as rooting. However,
the effectiveness of this approach directly depends on what data is exposed
through some of the system services aforementioned.

## The Application
The Android application is written in _Kotlin_. It consists of three components.

- A user interface,
- A voting mechanism to detect advertisements,
- And a notification listener service to monitor system events.

You can find the source-code on
[GitHub](https://github.com/abertschi/ad-free/tree/master/app/src/main/java/ch/abertschi/adfree).

### User Interface

The application implements some derivation of _Model-View-Presenter_ with the
following goals:

- The application is simple, no need for many layers of abstractions,
- The level of abstraction should at least separate actions from UI widgets.

[ModPresenter](https://github.com/abertschi/ad-free/blob/master/app/src/main/java/ch/abertschi/adfree/view/mod/ModPresenter.kt)
and
[ModActivity](https://github.com/abertschi/ad-free/blob/master/app/src/main/java/ch/abertschi/adfree/view/mod/ModActivity.kt)
demonstrate some of these ideas in the code base of ad-free. Some design assets
of the interface are shown below.

### Voting Mechanism
Ad-free implements various detectors. A detector receives some execution context
and then parses the context for anomalies that are present if an advertisement
is playing. The execution context is provided by a Notification Listener or
Accessibility service. An anomaly may be some payload in a bundle or a UI widget
always present. A detector then votes whether it thinks it found an
advertisement. A manager subsequently collects these votes and decides what to
do. There are currently ca. 20 detectors implemented.


```kotlin
interface AdDetectable 
{
    fun getMeta(): AdDetectorMeta
    fun canHandle(p: AdPayload): Boolean
    fun flagAsAdvertisement(payload: AdPayload): Boolean
    fun flagAsMusic(payload: AdPayload): Boolean
}

data class AdDetectorMeta(val title: String, 
     val description: String, var enabledByDef: Boolean = true,
     var debugOnly: Boolean = false, var category: String = "General")
```
{{< caption >}}All detectors of ad-free implement this contract. Given some payload, a detector can flag an event as music or advertisement. {{< /caption >}}

### Replacing Audio with nonsensical Advertisements
As an Easter egg, I added a feature to replace the audio advertisement with
nonsensical advertisements from the television show _Rick and Morty_. The series
features _interdimensional cable_: cable television with [absurd and yet
creative advertisements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h58uT_BGV4) from
fictional alternative universes.

This Easter egg quickly received some attention on the interwebs. However, I only
briefly included it in the app.

[AudioManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioManager),
Android's audio system, provides several streams on which audio is played. Music
players play audio on the stream
[STREAM_MUSIC](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioManager#STREAM_MUSIC).
There are alternative streams available, such as
[STREAM_VOICE_CALL](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioManager#STREAM_VOICE_CALL).
This stream targets the ear speaker in the phone and is used for phone calls.
However, if the phone is connected to external speakers such as headphones, this
stream is forwarded to the headphones as well. Hence, by lowering the volume on
_STREAM\_MUSIC_ and playing sound on _STREAM\_VOICE\_CALL_ we can play arbitrary
audio during advertisements.

Based on this idea, ad-free features music plugins that perform some action during ads.
For instance, the _local music_ plugin plays audio tracks on the device.

## Conclusion
Notification and Accessibility services expose much sensitive data to
non-privileged apps on the system. Hence, it is of utter importance to
carefully decide if a given app should be granted permission to this data.

Ad-free is solely a proof-of-concept and not
published in Google's Play Store. However, the source code is available on
F-Droid and [GitHub](https://github.com/abertschi/ad-free).

Tackling down some of the technical challenges has been much fun. Even if this
app only lowers the phone volume, muting ads may not be supported and may be against
terms of services of your music player. Advertisements can be dubious by wiring
desires, morals, and unwanted default values into our brains. Nonetheless, audio
streaming companies offer awesome services for non-paying users. If too many
users block audio advertisements, the industry may be forced to re-imagine its
funding model or free services would be much more limited.
